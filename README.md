Asynchronous Python client for the AdGuard Home API.

## About

This package allows you to control and monitor an AdGuard Home instance
programmatically. It is mainly created to allow third-party programs to automate
the behavior of AdGuard.

An excellent example of this might be Home Assistant, which allows you to write
automations, to turn on parental controls when the kids get home.

## Installation

```bash
pip install adguardhome
```

## Usage

```python
from adguardhome import AdGuardHome

import asyncio


async def main(loop):
    """Show example how to get status of your AdGuard Home instance."""
    async with AdGuardHome("192.168.1.2", loop=loop) as adguard:
        version = await adguard.version()
        print("AdGuard version:", version)

        active = await adguard.protection_enabled()
        active = "Yes" if active else "No"
        print("Protection enabled?", active)

        if not active:
            print("AdGuard Home protection disabled. Enabling...")
            await adguard.enable_protection()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(main(loop))
```

## Changelog & Releases

This repository keeps a change log using [GitHub's releases][releases]
functionality. The format of the log is based on
[Keep a Changelog][keepchangelog].

Releases are based on [Semantic Versioning][semver], and use the format
of ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``. In a nutshell, the version will be incremented
based on the following:

- ``MAJOR``: Incompatible or major changes.
- ``MINOR``: Backwards-compatible new features and enhancements.
- ``PATCH``: Backwards-compatible bugfixes and package updates.

## Contributing

This is an active open-source project. We are always open to people who want to
use the code or contribute to it.

We've set up a separate document for our
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thank you for being involved! :heart_eyes:

## Setting up development environment

In case you'd like to contribute, a `Makefile` has been included to ensure a
quick start.

```bash
make venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
make dev
```

Now you can start developing, run `make` without arguments to get an overview
of all make goals that are available (including description):

```bash
$ make
Asynchronous Python client for the AdGuard Home API.

Usage:
  make help                            Shows this message.
  make dev                             Set up a development environment.
